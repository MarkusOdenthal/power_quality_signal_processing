# power_quality_signal_processing

In this thesis the input parameters of a convolutional neural network are to be optimized. 
Power quality problems are represented by their harmonics. These are to be converted into 
spectrograms that serve as input to the neural network. The question now is: which orders 
of the harmonics are important, which image size, which spectorgram type, etc.
